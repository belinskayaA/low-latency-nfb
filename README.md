The repository contains script examples completed during the work in the Centre for Bioelectric Interfaces of HSE University as Researcher. 

The scripts are mainly related to the work on the [Real-time encephalography Project](https://bioelectric.hse.ru/en/real_time_encephalography). You can read more about the study and its results in the article - [Short-delay neurofeedback facilitates training of the parietal alpha rhythm
](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/abc8d7/meta?casa_token=1bC6CorvnqgAAAAA:vfcz9YIFVDAMUn-nZlbko1jsE4dao-l8EuzewnpLGn1s82AqRSmNVjpg1kbL9vEaIwQEKkL65SE-6UM).


The main idea is often encountered unreliable results of NFB intervention could be associated with large feedback latency values.

We engaged our subjects into a parietal alpha power unpregulating paradigm facilitated by visual NFB based on the individually extracted envelope of the alpha-rhythm at P4 electrode. NFB was displayed either as soon as an electroencephalographic (EEG) envelope was processed, or with an extra 250 or 500ms delay. The feedback training consisted of 15 two-minute long blocks interleaved with 15 s pauses. We have also recorded 2min long baselines immediately before and after the training.

As a result, feedback latency was shown to be a critical parameter in a range of applications that imply learning. 


The project contains many experiments. This repository only provides examples of technical scripts to show how to work with encephalographic data recorded during neurofeedback training.

| [01 - Check real latency](https://github.com/belinskayaA/!!!) | Since we were studying the effect of neurofeedback delay, it was important for us to always check what the REAL delay was in our experiment. Since we are giving real-time feedback, we need time to record the signal, extract the target rhythm envelope, and visualize the feedback. Real-time envelope extraction requires the use of specific signal analysis techniques, which also produce a delay, since we cannot accurately predict how the signal will change in the future. To find out how long this whole process takes, we can take an offline record and calculate the instantaneous alpha amplitude on it, extracted from an EEG with zero delay in an offline analysis. After correlating these two signals, this way we will know the accuracy of our neurofeedback and its delay. | `pylab` `numpy` `scipy.signal` `scipy.stats` `h5py` |
